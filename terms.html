            Oahu Dental Group is proud to offer our patients Whitening For Life!  We pride ourselves on the smiles that leave our practice.  We also pride ourselves on knowing our patients are maintaining the best possible oral health.   White Teeth For Life was developed for those patients that are already taking their dental health seriously, and as an incentive for those who need a little help keeping up with their dental care.  The patient will receive custom made, professional, take home whitening trays and gel for personal use.<br><br>
            As with any program, there is always fine print, but the details are simple.   Below are a list of the detail for the Whitening For Life program.

Oahu Dental Group will make whitening trays for any of our current patients age 18 and older that are medically and dentally able to receive tooth whitening, following a regular prophy and exam.

For patients that have had whitening with our office there is no fee to participate. For new patients Whitening For Life is free with a paid exam and x-rays.(*Free Whitening offer can not be combined with any other coupons or specials.)<br>

            <strong>Patient Responsibilities</strong><br>
            1.   You must be a new or current patient on our active files and should have a prophy and exam prior to the impression appointment.<br>
            2.    Patients  must keep their regular scheduled  prophy, exam and x-ray appointments.<br>
            3.   If a change comes in your schedule, we require 24  hours notice so other patients can be served during your previously scheduled appointment.  We will require that you schedule within 2 weeks of the previously scheduled appointment date.<br>
            4.   Two whitening gel syringe will be rewarded at each prophy appointment.  Additional syringes can be purchased for $15.00.<br>
